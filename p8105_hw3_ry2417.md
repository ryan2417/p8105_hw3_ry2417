In 2002, states that were observed at 7 or more locations are CT, FL,
MA, NC, NJ, PA. In 2010, states that were observed at 7 or more
locations are CA, CO, FL, MA, MD, NC, NE, NJ, NY, OH, PA, SC, TX, WA.

Make a “spaghetti” plot of the average data value over time within a
state

``` r

Make a two-panel plot showing, for the years 2006, and 2010,

## Problem 3

import and clean data set for problem 3 from data `accel_data`

``` r
p3_df <- 
  read_csv(

  janitor::clean_names() %>%

    minute_of_day = as.numeric(minute_of_day),
    week_vs_weekend = ifelse(day %in% c("Sunday", "Saturday"), "weekend", "week")

Some numerical descriptions of data

``` r

There are 50400 observations of 6 variables in data. Each observation is
the observation of one minute collected on a 63 year-old male. The
variables include week, day, day\_of\_week, minute\_of\_day,
activity\_in\_minute, week\_vs\_weekend. The average activity count per
minute is 267.0440592. Here is the examples of some observations

Day2, day24 and day31 have the total activities that much lower than
other days.  

Make a single-panel plot that shows the 24-hour activity time courses
for each day and use color to indicate day of the week.

``` r
p3_df %>% 
  mutate(
    hour_of_day = minute_of_day/60
  ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = hour_of_day, 
             y = activity_in_minute, 
             group = day, 
             color = day_of_week)) +
  geom_point(alpha = .1) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(y = "activity count",
       x = "hour of day",
    title = "24-hour activity for each day ",
    caption = "Data from accel_data",
    colour = "day of week") +
  scale_x_continuous(
    breaks = 0:24
  ) +
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 7),
    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 7),
    axis.title = element_text(size = 9),
    plot.title = element_text(size = 12),
    plot.caption = element_text(size = 5),
    legend.title = element_text(size = 8),
    legend.text = element_text(size = 7),
    legend.key.size = unit(0.2, "cm")
  ) +
  guides(color = guide_legend(nrow = 1))
```

From the plot, we can see that activity is extremely high during 7pm to
10pm and moderately high between 6am to 12pm and 4pm to 5pm. The overall
activity is more stable and lower on Tuesday than other days of week.
There are high activity in the afternoon and evening on Friday and
Saturday. The activity of Sunday is concentrated between 11am to 12 pm.
